# NoobieAlgorithmLibrary
Total noob for algorithms. Prefer to understand concepts with trial and error rather than memorise.
The library that I am going to build will be made of my own code that will reflect upon my understanding of concepts and algorithms that- 
I will learn in the future.

Sometimes I have doubts with the way I write code because after comparing with other's algorithms for a concept, I could not judge whether my code
is truly efficient.
I believe that learning from criticism is important for my growth and development as a programmer and as a (gonna be) computer scientist
Pleasure working with anyone who is contributing their suggestions and wisdom to this repository!!!!!!!!!
